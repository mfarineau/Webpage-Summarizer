# Webpage Summarizer Extension

A simple Chrome extension that uses OpenAI to summarize the current page or selected text. The popup also provides utilities like ad removal, framework detection and domain info lookup.

## Summary History

Every time a summary is generated the extension saves it locally with the page URL and timestamp. Click the **History** button in the popup to view your saved summaries. From the history page you can open the original page or delete individual entries.
