# Webpage Summarizer Extension

A simple Chrome extension that uses OpenAI to summarize the current page or selected text. The summary popup now includes a few images from the page and the popup provides utilities like ad removal, framework detection, domain info lookup and basic cookie management.

## Summary History

Every time a summary is generated the extension saves it locally with the page URL and timestamp. Click the **History** button in the popup to view your saved summaries. From the history page you can open the original page or delete individual entries.

## Manage Cookies

Use the **Manage Cookies** button in the popup to identify common tracking cookies set by the current site. If any are found you'll be prompted to remove them.
